# Support

Please use the [TYPO3 mailing lists](http://typo3.org/support/mailing-lists/) for free support, or contact me directly for paid support.

As I still don't use PHP or TYPO3 myself, maintaining JobControl is purely a hobby and most new features will need to come from the community. I'll keep it bug free, but can't give free support for example.
