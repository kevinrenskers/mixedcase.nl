# Support
Please use the [TYPO3 mailing lists](http://typo3.org/support/mailing-lists/) for free support, or [contact me directly](mailto:info@mixedcase.nl) for paid support.

As I don't use PHP or TYPO3 myself anymore, maintaining JobControl is purely a hobby. I'll keep it bug free, but simply can't give free support. 

## Bug reports
Please file an issue at <https://github.com/kevinrenskers/dmmjobcontrol/issues>.

## Feature requests
If you have a feature request, forking the code and coding it yourself is probably the best solution. Just send a pull request to get your code into the extension. 

Alternatively you can sponsor the development of your new feature. If I feel that your feature will benefit the community at large, I'll let you donate whatever you feel the new feature is worth to you. On the other hand, if the feature is very specialized and basically only useful to you, I'll come up with a minimum donation.

## Contribute
Please feel free to fork the code at https://github.com/kevinrenskers/dmmjobcontrol and submit a pull request. Translations, bug fixes, new features, documentation, anything is welcome.

## Donations
Please feel free to support the development of [open feature requests waiting for a sponsor](https://github.com/kevinrenskers/dmmjobcontrol/issues?labels=Waiting+for+sponsor&page=1&state=open).
