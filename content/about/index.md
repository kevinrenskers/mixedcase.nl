---------------------

I'm **Kevin Renskers**, and I am a developer from The Netherlands, living in Iceland.

Iâ€™m a creative developer with a a passion for good design and intuitive, user friendly interfaces. I love working on the front end, whether that's creating a beautiful and performant UI for iOS apps or using HTML, CSS and Javascript to create interactive and responsive websites.

I also like working on the back end: I use Python and the Django framework to create complex web applications and open API's for the web. Combine these two interests, and you can see why I love making responsive, intuitive, usable and interactive "web 2.0" user experiences and API-driven iOS apps.

Usability and design are always on my mind, even when writing code: this should be usable, readable and beautiful too. I always strive to create reusable code that can be shared with the world. Currently I'm maintaining about 10 open source projects on GitHub.

I'm online since 1994, creating websites since 2000 and iOS apps since 2010. My CV can be downloaded [here](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2310965/KevinRenskers.pdf) and you can find my open source projects on [/projects](/projects).
