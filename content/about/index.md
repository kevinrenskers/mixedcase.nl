# About me
- menu: About
---------------------

## Hello! 
My name is **Kevin Renskers**.

I'm a creative [freelance developer](https://loopwerk.io) (**I’m available!**) with 18 years of experience and a passion for good design and intuitive, user friendly interfaces. Usability and design are always on my mind, even when writing code: this should be usable, readable and beautiful too. I enjoy writing good API designs, README's and documentation.

By day I make mobile apps for iOS, web apps with JavaScript and API’s with Python. At night I’m looking for the best burger in the world.

I've been online since 1994, creating websites since 2000 and iOS apps since 2010. You can find my open source projects on [/projects][projects] and a portfolio of mobile apps I've created on [/apps][apps].

If you need a second opinion on your app idea, a pair of eyes to look at your new website, someone to do a code review or architecture assessment, you can also hire me via my website [OpinionsForSale.com](https://www.opinionsforsale.com).

You can download my CV [here](/about/KevinRenskers.pdf).
