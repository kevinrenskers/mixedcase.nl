# About me
- menu: About
---------------------

I'm **Kevin Renskers**, and I am a developer from The Netherlands, living in Iceland.

I love the frontend side of webapplications: from interface- and interaction design to HTML, CSS and javascript. From listening to clients about their wishes and goals to usability testing.

I also like working on the backend: I use Python and the Django framework to create complex applications for the web. Combine these two interests, and you can see why I love making responsive, intuitive, usable and interactive "web 2.0" user experiences.

When I'm not working on webapplications I create iPhone- and iPad apps in Objective-C, or Mac OS X desktop applications using MacRuby and Objective-C. I have published multiple apps in Apple's App Store.

Usability and design are always on my mind. I code to create beautiful things on screen - any screen. Code should be usable, readable and beautiful too.

I'm online since 1994, creating websites since 2000 and iOS apps since 2010. My CV can be downloaded [here](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2310965/KevinRenskers.pdf) and you can find my open source projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/kevinrenskers).
