## Profile
Hello! My name is **Kevin Renskers**, and I am a developer from The Netherlands, living in Iceland.

I'm a creative developer with a passion for good design and intuitive, user friendly interfaces. Usability and design are always on my mind, even when writing code: this should be usable, readable and beautiful too. I enjoy writing good API designs, README's and documentation.

I've been online since 1994, creating websites since 2000 and iOS apps since 2010. You can find my open source projects on [/projects][projects] and a portfolio of mobile apps I've created on [/apps][apps].
