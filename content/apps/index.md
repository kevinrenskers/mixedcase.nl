iOS apps I've worked on. I was either the only developer on the project, or the lead developer with more people on the team.

## Agenda Oosterpoort Stadsschouwburg Groningen

My first iOS app, created in 2010. At first I wanted to use Appcelerator Titanium because I didn't know any Objective-c, but quickly [changed my mind](/articles/2010/04/21/getting-started-iphone-app-development/) and learned the proper skills instead. I actually rewrote the entire app after I submitted the "Agenda Groninger Forum" app, because I learned so much in such a short time and wasn't happy with my first effort anymore - the curse of every good developer.

This app shows the program for a local theater and its Twitter feed. It's available for iPhone and iPad (universal build).

## Agenda Groninger Forum

View the program and Twitter feed for a local institute. Available as an universal build. Looking back, the iPad version was a poor effort, simply a bigger version of the iPhone app. It was my first universal app though, and I do like the dark design. After I submitted this app, I rewrote the "Agenda Oosterpoort" app to be universal as well.

## Noorderlink

After I created two iOS app using native development tools and Objective-c, I decided to give Appcelerator Titanium another try, mainly because the client wanted an Android app as well. At first [everything was going well](/articles/2010/11/09/once-again-i-turn-appcelerator/), but in the end we got two mediocre apps and decided to start from scratch, using native SDK's for both iOS and Android. I'm glad that we did.

This app is for finding jobs in the north of The Netherlands.

## Radio.com v2

My first major app, built early 2012 in Iceland for CBS IMG. Listen to over 400 streaming radio stations, view artists biographies, pictures, song lyrics, news headlines and more. I'm still very proud of this app, I especially like the sliding menu on the bottom. It has a couple of million users in the United States.
