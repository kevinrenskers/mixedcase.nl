## mixedWhat?
The name mixedCase comes from the Python programming language. It is better known as the camelCase naming style. On this blog I write about design, usability and development.

## aboutMe
I'm Kevin Renskers, a Dutch freelance developer. By day I make mobile apps for iOS, web apps with JavaScript and API’s with Python. At night I’m looking for the best burger in the world.
