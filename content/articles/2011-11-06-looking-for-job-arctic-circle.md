# Looking for a job in the Arctic Circle
For more then ten years I've been telling friends and family that I'd like to emigrate to another country. I have long thought that this other country would be Scotland, but about six months ago I've changed my mind: I want to move to the Arctic Circle instead. And by that I mean the north of Norway (Tromsø, Bodø, Trondheim), Sweden (Luleå , Kiruna) or Finland (Rovaniemi, Oulu), or Iceland (Reykjavik). Canada would be very nice too, but I hear it's almost impossible to get permission to live and work there.

I have been looking for jobs in these cities, but found that it's quite difficult: most companies use local jobboards that I don't even know exist, and many job postings are in their local language. But still: I have had one job interview in Tromsø and four in Reykjavik, although without much success. One liked me, but my skills had too much overlap with the rest of the team, another decided to suddenly pull all vacancies, one wanted to pay as little as possible (and it wasn't enough), number four had a horrible office and the one I am most positive about can only hire me if one of their current employees decides to leave.

So, it's been a couple of months since my big decision and I am still looking for a job. I hope that someone out there has a job for me, or knows someone else who does. I can use all the help I can get!

I am a 29 year old creative webdeveloper who loves both the back end (Python, Django, Node.js) and the front end (HTML5, jQuery, CSS, Less, Coffeescript). Besides programming for the web I've also created a couple of iPhone and iPad applications. I like typography, interface- and interaction design and usability. I code to create beautiful things on screen -- any screen.

My ideal company is small, fun, flexible, has an open source mindset, and great people who kick ass and like to drink beer once in a while. Everyone should be able to speak English, bonus points if it's the primary language at the office.

I have a [LinkedIn profile](http://nl.linkedin.com/in/kevinrenskers) and my [CV is posted online](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2310965/KevinRenskers.pdf).
