# Finding a solution for backing up all my pictures to the cloud
I have well over 25 GB of pictures, and after almost losing my hard drive (it started to behave very strangely but I was able to salvage all the pictures) I realized that I need to back them up in the cloud. I do usually share my best ones on Facebook, but I need a solution that backs up every picture (full-resolution with all its metadata intact) without ever thinking about it.

I'll need a place to host all those pictures and I'll need some kind of automated workflow. The first storage options that come to mind are Dropbox, Facebook, Google+ and Flickr.

I'd like to be able to simply store my pictures in some folder on my hard drive, and without thinking about it they would be uploaded automatically. It seems that's only possible with Dropbox, which I love anyway, but.. I'd have to get a Pro account and it doesn't handle my second wish.

I'd also like to be able to show my pictures to the world. So I want ALL my pictures to be uploaded, and then I would select a few of those and make them public. 

So if I combine the 2 wishes (ease of upload and ease of showing), then I come to the conclusion that this isn't possible:

- Dropbox has the ease of auto uploading, but it can't show picture galleries like an actual photo site. I would also need to pay for a Pro account ($99 for 100 GB).
- Facebook seems to have unlimited photo upload, but also has no way to auto upload my photos. As a photo gallery it's not as good as Flickr for example.
- Google+: on iOS they have auto uploading of all your pictures which you can then make public. Also unlimited space, awesome. But, no auto uploading/syncing from desktop and all photos will be resized. I want a true, full-resolution backup, so this isn't an option.
- Flickr: they now offer 1 TB of free storage and you can upload everything as private and then selectively make some public. No easy way to get your photos into Flickr though, certainly not automatic.

If I simply want all my pictures in the cloud without ever thinking about it, then Dropbox definitely seems like the best option. Simply plugin the camera, import the pictures to my Dropbox folder and away they go. 

If I also want to be able to (selectively) show them to the world then Flickr seems like the best option, **if** I would find a way to automatically upload everything. I could maybe adopt a new workflow where I would use iPhoto or Aperture, keep all my photos in the app and sync to Flickr from there. It would be a major change for me, from simply importing photos into a folder on my hard drive. I also don't really like the whole "pictures in a black box database" philosophy that iPhoto and Aperture have. Plus, it's still not an automated process where I'd never have to think about this.

Other options I'm thinking about but haven't tried out yet:

- Apple's photostream only hold 1000 photos, but using shared photostreams you can get around this limit. All pictures taken with my iPhone would be automatically uploaded, other pictures can be uploaded via iPhoto or Aperture.
- [Picturelife](https://picturelife.com) has the automated syncing on the desktop and iOS apps to view the photos. At $70 per year for 100 GB it's cheaper then Dropbox.
- [Everpix](https://www.everpix.com) is only $49 per year and offers unlimited hosting. Their image analysis seems cool as well. Just too bad that the website doesn't offer any information. Is there a desktop app that sync a folder to Everpix? Do I need to manually import stuff? No idea.
- [Loom](http://www.loom.com) looks very similar to Everpix but at the moment has a waiting list. At $40 for 50 GB it seems like a good option to explore once the waiting is over.

Not sure how long companies like Picturelife, Everpix and Loom will be around for. Using Dropbox or Flickr seems more future-proof. I still think that Flickr would be the best option once I figure out how to automatically sync from the desktop.

Any suggestions for a pain free photo workflow with online backup are more then welcome!
