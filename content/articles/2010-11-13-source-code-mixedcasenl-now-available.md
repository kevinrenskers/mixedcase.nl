This website uses quite some Django packages, like Django-CMS and Zinnia. A lot of effort has been put into integrating everything nicely into the design and templates, like comments, sitemaps, archives, Pygments, Markdown, etc.

I understand that for beginning Django developers, building a site like this could take a lot of time and effort, not knowing where to begin. That's why I've decided to open source the entire website. Feel free to have a look around and maybe learn a bit or two.
