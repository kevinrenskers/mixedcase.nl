# Brand new design, comments reenabled
I've worked hard on a brand new design for Bolhoed.net, and I must say: I am quite happy and proud of it. It took 4 nights of work to redesign everything. There are 3 versions: for big and small resolutions, and a mobile version for really small resolutions.

I also implemented "Disqus":http://disqus.com, so once again there is the possibility to comment on blog posts, sans spam this time.
