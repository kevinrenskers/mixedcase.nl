# Comments closed
Because I was getting a lot of spam in my comments, I've closed it down entirely for now, until I can come up with a solution (and find time to build it).

I am thinking about requiring the visitor to authenticate using an OpenID provider, or using a Twitter or Google account. Or alternatively, the user gets an activation link in his email, which he needs to click before the comment will be public.

I guess this _should_ be possible using the standard comments framework Django offers, but I am hoping for a nice out-of-the-box solution. If anyone can point me in the right direction, please email me, or send me a [Tweet](http://twitter.com/vrot). Thanks!
