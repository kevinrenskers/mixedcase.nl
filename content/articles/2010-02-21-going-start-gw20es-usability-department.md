# Going to start GW20e's usability department
Good news! I've had my permanent-contract negotiation at [Goldmund, Wyldebeast & Wunderliebe](http://gw20e.com) (or GW20e for short) last week, and one of the things we talked about was my desire to start a new usability department. The bosses liked the idea and gave me the green light. Services we are likely going to offer:

* Integrated usability testing and -reviews for software we develop
* Purely stand-alone usability testing for new clients
* Accessibility testing
* Wireframe models to test the usability before we even start the actual coding of websites and web applications
* Expert review and user testing

Our website needs to be updated to describe these new services (a completely new layout is coming too), and then I can begin building my network of clients. I am also looking into tools to make building wireframes an easy task, and can use your input.

I will update this blog as we start setting up the usability department. I am very excited about this, it's something I wanted to do for a long time!
